To set up a virtual machine with no GUI on a Windows system, the following steps can be followed:

Choose a virtualization platform: There are various virtualization platforms available, such as VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V, and others. Choose the one that suits your needs.

Download the ISO image: Download the ISO image of the operating system that you want to install on the virtual machine. Ensure that the ISO image is compatible with the virtualization platform.

Create a new virtual machine: Open the virtualization platform and create a new virtual machine. Specify the amount of RAM, CPU cores, and storage that you want to allocate to the virtual machine.

Attach the ISO image: In the virtual machine settings, attach the downloaded ISO image to the virtual CD/DVD drive. This will allow the virtual machine to boot from the ISO image.

Install the operating system: Start the virtual machine and follow the operating system installation process. Configure the operating system to your requirements.

Configure network settings: Once the operating system is installed, configure the network settings of the virtual machine. This includes assigning an IP address, configuring DNS settings, and setting up any required network services.

Install necessary software: Install any necessary software on the virtual machine. This may include web servers, database servers, and other tools that you need to use.

With these steps, you can set up a virtual machine with no GUI on a Windows system, which can be used for various purposes such as testing software, running servers, and more
